## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

While at the Eiteljorg Museum, I noticed there was a surplus of art work that included hats, horses, or both. So I thought it would be an excellent idea to accumulate all those art pieces into a database and distinguish them as having hats, horses, or both. My app would be called "Hats & Horses of the Eiteljorg" and would allow visitors to search for art work surrounding everybody's two favorite subjects and what exhibit they can locate it at.

### Core Webpages

The home page will have the name of the app and under it will be a hero image of a painting at the Eiteljorg that includes a horse and a hat. Under it will give a brief description of the museum and then below that will have three boxes spaced evenly each with a different label: Hats, Horses, & Both. Each box will have a painting from the museum as the background to coorelate with the label. When you click on the box you want, it will take you to the appropriate database and will be separated by exhibit. You can click on the art work to find out more about the story and the painter.

### Design Choices

I would like to mimic MOMA's website. On their home page, they have boxes you can click on that bring you to artist collections, which is similar to my idea. The website is also sleek and easy to navigate. I would use more earthy colors when making mine, though, to imitate the colors in most of the paintings.
